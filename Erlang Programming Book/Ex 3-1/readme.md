# Exercise 3-1: Evaluating Expressions

Write a function `sum/1` which, given a positive integer `N`, will return the sum of all the integers between 1 and N.

Example:
```
sum(5) => 15.
```

Write a function `sum/2` which, given two integers `N` and `M`, where `N <= M`, will return the sum of the interval between `N` and `M`. If `N > M`, you want your process to terminate abnormally.

Example: 
```
sum(1,3) => 6.      
sum(6,6) => 6.
```
