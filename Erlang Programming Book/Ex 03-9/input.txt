The word Erlang will appear twice in this line because we wrote Erlang two times.
On the second line there is also a mention of Erlang.
No mentions of that awesome language on line 3.
Line 4 is all about Erlang.
Erlang is also on line 5.
Erlang Erlang, you get my point.
Line 98!?? Wait, what?!! Here we go to line 98!

























































































After a lot of enters!!!
Line 98 here it is, the great Erlang!

Apparently also on line 100 there is Erlang.

And twice in 102 Erlang, dájà vu, Erlang.

Ano that's all folks!
Fábio.
