# Exercise 3-9: Indexing

A *raw document* is a list of lines (i.e., strings) whereas a *document* is a list of words. Write a function to read a text file into a raw document and then a document.

You want to write an index for a document. This will give a list of words paired with their occurrences, so that the word Erlang might have the following entry:
```
{ "Erlang", [1,1,2,4,5,6,6,98,100,102,102] }
```
