# Exercise 7-4: Records and Shapes

Define a record type to represent circles; define another to represent rectangles. You should assume the following:

* A circle has a radius.
* A rectangle has a length and a width.

Give functions that work over these types to give `perimeter` and `area` of these geometric figures. Once this is completed, add the code for triangles to your tipe definitions and functions, where you can assume the triangle is described by the lengths of its three sides.
